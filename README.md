# Open Source

Here at Softsquirrel Studios, we believe that code should be open source, so that's what we did! We are now turning our project's into Open source project's by uploading our code to Github. You can even see Debitstore's code [here](https://github.com/Squirrelcoding/DebitStore)

# Notes
- Packager files were removed intentionally
- Downloading Feature is a bit buggy but who cares.
